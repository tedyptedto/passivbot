# Forager

Moves passivbots around to wherever volatility is highest.  

## How it works

The script does the following:
- fetch min costs for all symbols
- filter symbols by min cost
- get ohlcvs for all approved symbols
- filter symbols by volume, unilateralness, noisiness
- get the account's currently active bots
- generate and dump yaml file with new bots and old bots with graceful-stop
- sleep for 60 secs to avoid API rate limiting due to many calls to fetch ohlcvs
- kill previous tmux session
- use tmuxp to load new tmux session
- sleep for one hour
- repeat



## Usage
```shell
python3 forager.py configs/forager/config_file.hjson
```

## Requirements
In addition to requirements.txt, tmux and tmuxp
