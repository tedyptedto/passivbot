    WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW THE BOT BEHAVES, OR ANY LOSSES THAT MAY BE A RESULT OF USING THE BOT!

    If you don't understand how the bot works, you should not use it. You are always welcome to ask for help or get more
    information on how it works exactly if the documentation does not provide enough information. 

## Overview

Passivbot is a fully automated trading bot built in Python. The goal of Passivbot is to provide a stable, risk-free
trading bot that is able to accumulate profit over time without manual actions.

Passivbot trades using futures markets, using an advanced form of grid trading to place opening and closing orders.

It provides support for automatically optimize configurations, backtest using historic data, and running in live mode.

## Supported exchanges

Currently the following exchanges are implemented and supported for trading futures. The bot does not use
ccxt, so other exchanges cannot be used.

!!! Info
    If you would like to have support added for an exchange not supported yet, 
    you can always get in touch to see  what the  options are

## Software Requirements

The following requirements are applicable for installing Passivbot:

- Git 2.17 or above
- Python 3.8.x (newer versions aren't supported yet)
- Supported OS: 
    - Mac
    - Linux
    - Windows

## Hardware requirements

Passivbot is a very lightweight bot, and can easily be run on a single-core machine with 1GB of RAM.
While the hardware requirements are very low, you may run into issues when running it on things like a Raspberry Pi.
In case you do, please let us know so we can help out & improve the bot!

!!! Warning
    It should be very possible to run multiple bots on a single machine. Be aware that you may run into other
    limitations like rate limiting of exchanges.
