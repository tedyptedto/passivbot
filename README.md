# Trading bot running on Bybit and Binance Futures

:warning: **Use at own risk** :warning:

## Overview

Passivbot is a trading bot written in Python to automate trading on exchanges.
The philosophy behind the bot is to have a bot that you can simply run and forget about.
The goal is to make the bot make 1% profit daily, where the compound interest will strongly increase
profit over time.

Passivbot operates on futures markets based on trading ticks provided via websocket, and can run completely autonomously.

Using Passivbot, you are able to optimize & backtest a configuration and run it live. The bot can be controlled via Telegram.

There is no strategy that needs to built, it only needs a predefined configuration to run.
